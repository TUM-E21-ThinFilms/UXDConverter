            and thus we just take one of the measurements in the overlap region.
            At the other two regions, we just take one of the measurements (after a re-scaling).

            A user-defined scaling_factor can be passed by the argument.
            An averaging function at the overlap region can be performed by the averaging=True parameter.

                The scaling factor is calculated to be bigger than 1 and is chosen to minimize the following problem:

                min_{alpha > 0} || f - \alpha g ||^2 = min_{\alpha > 0} \sum_{i=1}^{n} | f(x_i) - \alpha g(x_i) | ^2
